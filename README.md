# Inequality

The JUST Capital Foundation is an independent non-profit organization based in New York City to make positive social impact using the power of the markets. The organization provides information and rankings of large publicity-traded corporations based on issues that matter most to the public. The major question to answer in this project is JUST Capital data on corporate behavior, on the issues important to the American public, can be linked to population-wide measures of economic inequality. The relationship between company presence, JUST performance data, and economic inequality outcomes per county would be explored in this project. This project investigates and quantifies whether the corporations with highest ranking in JUST Capital have a positive effect on the county placed in.
